# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

The two projects I submitted involved creating a Morse code and using a temperature sensor to read the room temperature. For the Morse rose, the objective was to create a synchronous state machine that reads the Morse code for "SOS" and "OK." The code will begin reading the SOS morse code, and once the user presses the toggle button, the morse code will switch to read "OK" once the initial morse code is completed and vice versa. The second project included using the LED on the board to indicate where the heat is on or off. The toggle buttons used in the project are used to increase and decrease the temperature. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

Both assignments were a challenge. However, I excelled in implementing the code. With both assignments, the goal was to make each portion into smaller code blocks to ensure each portion was functional. Since the code blocks were also smaller, increasing their readability and making them more manageable to maintain was easier. Because it was easier to maintain, I had no issues during the debugging. I could use my time wisely and efficiently.

3. Where could you improve?

One area in which I needed improvement was developing a more straightforward state diagram. I spent most of my time focusing on the code, and the documentation was required to be more precise. I may have overthought the situation in the document but I also felt that I did not convey enough information to describe the flow chart adequately. I can improve by enabling myself to practice more going forward.

4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Prior to this course, I had very little knownledge towards embedded systems. However, there were many learning experinces I was not away of such as the various tools and topics used in the course. In the future, I plan to continue to use the TI microcontroller to learn new materials. 

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

skills learned from this course were beneficial, and I plan to continue focusing on areas of improvement. The state diagram is essential because it demonstrates the process and streamlines the system's activity. In the future, I will also ensure to implement continuous testing, developing code with readability and maintainability, but also constantly staying up-to-date on current trends with embedded systems so my information is not outdated

6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I focused on what was deemed best industry practice to ensure the projects were maintainable, readable, and adaptable. One of the main goals I implemented was to ensure codes were broken into smaller chunks to ensure the code's readability. When code is broken into smaller segments, it becomes easier for other developers involved in the project. Different portions of the code were used to ensure the comments were also easier to understand. This is beneficial for others reading the code and for me because it enables me to review the code's logic.
